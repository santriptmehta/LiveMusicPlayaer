# LiveMusicPlayaer
• In a real-time-data music player, music data is read from the Firebase as RealtimeDatabases and
synchronized.
• Used Firebase-Firestore to keep data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners.
• Developed and learned the MVVM architecture to make sure the design pattern was covered in unit
testing and to ensure that other classes didn’t interface with it.
